# [ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ Join the ArcanePlugins Discord Server ðŸ‘ˆðŸ‘ˆ][INVITE]

<br><br>

This is the **best** place to discuss and request help for resources by ArcanePlugins, lokka30, and stumper66/PenalBuffalo.

When you join, you will be prompted on what plugins of ours you use. Please select accordingly, and read the rules. Some plugins have their own channels (like LevelledMobs), others you can just chat in the channel named after the publisher (i.e., `#other-lokka30-plugins` or `other-penalbuffalo-plugins`).

## Can't use Discord?

Here are a few alternative options you can look into.

* If you're reporting a bug, you can contact the author via a private message on SpigotMC or by filing an issue on the plugin's issue tracker on GitHub.
* If you're asking for help, making a suggestion, or just want to chat about the plugin, please send the author a private message on SpigotMC.

## Please Note

It's impossible for plugin authors to help members when they raise an issue in the reviews section rather than contacting the authors properly. Please don't use the reviews section for support or requesting features - contact us first!
